Vendor request numbers-- used for sending USB control requests to
GreatFET boards for non-bulk communication. These are still tenative.

When a final set is created, these should separate global requests (e.g.
requests that every GreatFET base should implement) from per-base requests.

Ideally we'll add an offset (100?) to per-board vendor requests to separate
requests that may differ from base-board to base-board.
